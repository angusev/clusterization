Here I share two solutions for dividing into clusters problem. 

First solution is based on finding minimum spanning tree: we are removing maximum edges from spanning tree while 
number of clusters is more than we need.

And an another one approach is greed: we are adding back minimum edges from empty graph until we have got number of 
clusters we want.
