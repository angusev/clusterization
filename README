Here I share two solutions for dividing into clusters problem. 

First solution is based on finding minimum spanning tree: we are adding minimum edges back beginning by spanning tree while number 
of clusters is less than we need.

And an another one approach is greed: remove maximum edges until we haven't got number of clusters we need.
